            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Cricket has always been a sport where raw talent meets opportunity. However, with the rise of franchise leagues, domestic tournaments, and international schedules, the challenge is no longer just about talent—but about visibility. While some players make headlines through conventional pathways, many promising cricketers remain under the radar, despite having performance metrics comparable to top-tier players.</p>
            
            <p>This scouting report aims to bridge that gap by using data-driven analysis to identify emerging stars—players who may not yet have the spotlight but have consistently delivered in domestic circuits. By leveraging advanced statistical metrics, this report presents a rigorous, unbiased evaluation of players who have outperformed expectations and could soon make their mark on the bigger stage.</p>
            
            <h3>Purpose of the Report</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>To identify and analyse top-performing domestic players who have the potential to break into international cricket.</li>
                <li>To compare their key performance metrics with established players and highlight why they stand out.</li>
                <li>To provide insights into their playing style and impact, offering a data-backed approach to talent scouting.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Methodology</h3>
            <p>This report follows a quantitative and qualitative approach to player scouting. Players were selected based on:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Performance Metrics:</strong> Consistency, Impact, Efficiency (e.g., Strike Rate, Economy Rate, Wicket %, Boundary %).</li>
                <li><strong>Role-Specific Strengths:</strong> Identifying batters who dominate in different phases of the game & bowlers who thrive under pressure.</li>
                <li><strong>Comparative Analysis:</strong> Evaluating how domestic talent stacks up against established international players.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h2>Identifying the Next Generation of Game-Changing Batters</h2>
            <p>In modern cricket, batting is no longer just about scoring runs—it's about how quickly and effectively those runs are scored. With the rise of T20 leagues and aggressive ODI strategies, batters must adapt to different conditions, bowlers, and game situations.</p>
            
            <p>However, many promising batters in domestic circuits remain unnoticed despite their impressive numbers. This section aims to highlight underrated batting talents who have consistently delivered but have not yet received the recognition they deserve.</p>
            
            <h3>Player Criteria</h3>
            <p>The players are analysed based on Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy data from 2021 – 24. Below are the criteria to filter players from domestic circle and international circle to compare them.</p>
            
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>Stage</th>
                    <th>Min Matches</th>
                    <th>Min Runs</th>
                    <th>Notes</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>New Players (SMA)</td>
                    <td>15</td>
                    <td>350</td>
                    <td>No IPL/t20i after 2023</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Established Players (IPL/t20i)</td>
                    <td>90</td>
                    <td>2000</td>
                    <td></td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            
            <div class="criteria-box">
                <h3>What Makes a Batter Stand Out?</h3>
                <p>To ensure a data-driven and unbiased selection, this report evaluates batters based on:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Consistency Score</strong> – How often they score impactful runs (30+ per innings).</li>
                    <li><strong>Boundary %</strong> – Ability to accelerate the scoring rate with 4s & 6s.</li>
                    <li><strong>Strike Rate (Overall & Under Pressure)</strong> – Efficiency in normal & high-pressure situations (death overs).</li>
                    <li><strong>Dot Ball %</strong> – Ability to rotate strike and keep the scoreboard moving.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Impact score for each batter is calculated based on above mentioned 5 criteria as per weighted ranking to filter top performers.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Why This Matters?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>These batters have outperformed expectations in their respective domestic leagues.</li>
                <li>Their stats match or exceed those of established players, proving they are ready for bigger opportunities.</li>
                <li>By identifying them early, teams can invest in future match-winners before they hit mainstream recognition.</li>
